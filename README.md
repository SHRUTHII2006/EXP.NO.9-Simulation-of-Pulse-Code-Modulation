9.Simulation of PCM

# AIM

To simulate Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) for converting an analog signal into a digital signal through sampling, quantization, and encoding.

# SOFTWARE REQUIRED

Python Software -> Numpy Library -> Matplotlib Library -> Scipy Library (for signal processing)

# ALGORITHMS

Generate a sinusoidal analog signal.

Sample the analog signal at a fixed sampling rate.

Quantize the sampled values to the nearest available discrete level.

Convert the quantized values into binary form (encoding).

Transmit or store the binary-encoded data.

Decode the binary data back into quantized values.

Reconstruct the analog signal from the quantized samples using a reconstruction method (e.g., zero-order hold).

Plot the original analog signal, sampled signal, quantized signal, and reconstructed signal.
