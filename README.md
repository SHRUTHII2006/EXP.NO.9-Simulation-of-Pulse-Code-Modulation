# EXP.NO.9-Simulation-of-Pulse-Code-Modulation
9.Simulation of PCM

# AIM

To simulate Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) for converting an analog signal into a digital signal through sampling, quantization, and encoding.

# SOFTWARE REQUIRED

Python Software 

-> Numpy Library

-> Matplotlib Library

-> Scipy Library (for signal processing)

# ALGORITHMS

1.Generate a sinusoidal analog signal.

2.Sample the analog signal at a fixed sampling rate.

3.Quantize the sampled values to the nearest available discrete level.

4.Convert the quantized values into binary form (encoding).

5.Transmit or store the binary-encoded data.

6.Decode the binary data back into quantized values.

7.Reconstruct the analog signal from the quantized samples using a reconstruction method (e.g., zero-order hold).

8.Plot the original analog signal, sampled signal, quantized signal, and reconstructed signal.
